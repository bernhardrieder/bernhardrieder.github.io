## About
Redneck Rumble is a 3D local multiplayer action-arcade racer game for PC, in which the players need to adapt to regularly changing environmental conditions, score systems, and abilities to win the game. The polished prototype of the game is published on itch.io and is playable with four players and four gamepads. 

The development took place in a collaboration with three other students over four months. It was made for the final game development project in the study program of <a href="https://www.technikum-wien.at/en/study_programs/master_s/game_engineering_and_simulation_technology/">Game Engineering and Simulation Technology</a> at the <a href="https://www.technikum-wien.at/en/">University of Applied Sciences Technikum Wien</a>. Moreover, external artists provided the astonishing in-game art and sound which gives the game its beautiful look.

The idea behind Redneck Rumble was to develop an electrifying local-multiplayer game such as those addictive local-multiplayer games back in the day. With Redneck Rumble, we established precisely that electrifying, addictive and moreover, fun gameplay. The game itself takes place in an arena of death in which two teams are in a battle with each other. Furthermore, each player has available unique vehicle abilities, and each side tries to get as many points as possible to win the game. BUT, as already mentioned, there are uncontrollable and unforeseeable circumstances which affect the arena of death, every player, and the environment. These circumstances lead to complete chaos between the players and emerge in the craziest gameplay ever seen in the last decades! 

## Work
As already mentioned, the game was developed within four months of work which implicates that the whole project idea was a team effort and different tasks were often solved as a group. Nevertheless, every one had his special field of interest and responsibilities.

In the first days of the project, I took over the position of the project coordinator and manager, created the first draft of our development timeline, and set up the project management tool as well as our code and data repository. Furthermore, weekly meetings, milestones and tasks were created and established to secure the project's completion on time, playtests were established and implemented, and also general quality assurance was part of the agenda.  

The fact that I had the most experience with the game engine of our choice, promoted me to the lead programmer of the team. As the lead programmer, I was responsible for the code design and architecture, and came up with proper coding guidelines. At the beginning of the project, I set up the underlying code base and developed the prototype of the game, which then was broken down into different areas of features, so that every team member had clear structures and features to work on. My work continued with the implementation of core mechanics and gameplay, vehicle physics, as well as code quality assurance, optimizations and improvements, and game-polishing. 

## Team
