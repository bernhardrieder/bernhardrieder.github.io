## About
Space Dash: Earth Defender is a 2D space invaders-like casual arcade game with simple and addictive gameplay, published for iOS and Android. 

The development took place in close collaboration with three friends to gain a deeper understanding of game development. It was the first game development experience I have ever had and it revealed my passion for developing games as a programmer which continues and strengthens with every day.

## Work
As already indicated, my role and tasks in the project were mainly those of a programmer. However, since the team consisted only of four people, one needed to do a lot of other different work too - as it usually is for indie game developers. 

I was fully responsible for the implementation of the user interface, implemented some pieces of gameplay, integrated every sound effect in the game and created all special effects. Besides programming work, I was also involved co-creation of game concepts, playtest plans, and game design.
